Facebook Feed shortcode and widget for adding Facebook Feeds and Facebook Photos from any Public Facebook Page to your WordPress website.

== Description ==

The WP Social Plugin is an **easy-to-use** plugin that allows users to add a **custom Facebook Feed widgets** to the sidebar, as a widget, or to embed the custom Facebook Feed widget into a Page or Post using the shortcode, of any Public Facebook Page.  The WP Social Plugin also allows you to insert a Facebook Like Button widget into the Page, Post, or theme.  The WP Social Plugin allows you to add Facebook Events, Photos, and Galleries to your website, too!

WP Social Pro works with Facebook's Graph API to pull in your posts, comments, photos, videos. Your Facebook posts are each stored as a Custom Post Type, along with their comments, and photos you post on Facebook will be added to your Media Library. WP Social Pro will then periodically poll Facebook's Graph API, pulling in any new posts, likes, comments, or other meta data.

WP Social Pro can connect to any public Facebook page, and show its recent posts on your website. You can connect to your own pages, or you can connect to popular pages who’s content you’d like to share with your visitors (for example, adding the feed of a local news station). You can connect to as many feeds as you like.

We also have an setting for you to include your own custom CSS as well, for or you can simply include a stylesheet in your theme directory, and WP Social will automatically include it  -- either method is great for displaying a custom Facebook Feed widgets. The WP Social Plugin also includes a number of pre-made Feed Themes (more available with Pro), to help get you started with your custom Facebook Feed widgets.
